## Current research
With the start of my PhD, I have grown more interested in the application of Machine Learning and differentiable
programming in general
to get the most out of quantum computers in the near term.
I am currently working on encodings of time series into quantum computers, using
[this dataset](https://kelvins.esa.int/collision-avoidance-challenge/home/) from the European Space Agency (ESA).
I am also interested in the theoretical underpinnings of Quantum Machine Learning, at the intersection
of Statistical Learning Theory and Computational Theory.
