  DPhil student at the University of Oxford and part-time Research Software Developer at Cambridge Quantum Computing.
  My research interests lie mainly in the areas of quantum circuit optimisation and near-term applications of differential programming
  to NISQ devices.
  I previously obtained a Distinction for his MSc in Mathematics and Foundation of Computer Science at Oxford
  and two BSc degrees in Physics and Computer Science at ETH ZÃ¼rich.
