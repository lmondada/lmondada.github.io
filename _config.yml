  "Close-to-done" PhD student at the University of Oxford and Software Engineer at
  Quantinuum.
  My research interests lie mainly in the intersection of quantum compilation,
  graph transformation systems and high-performance computing for Quantum.
  I previously obtained a MSc in Mathematics and Foundation of Computer Science
  (with Distinction) at the University of Oxford
  and two BSc degrees in Physics and Computer Science at ETH ZÃ¼rich.
